# Conductor-HackRice <Vector>
HackRice hardware/webapp hack idea
A simple, motion based, Leap driven, Javascript powered musical game.
Idea began as a "Guitar Hero for composers"
Stripped the idea to its core and were left with the fundamentals of a music game.

Future development will seek to refine the current UI as well as the gesture recognition.
